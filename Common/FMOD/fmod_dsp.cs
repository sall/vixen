        The step parameter tells the gui or application that the parameter has a certain granularity.<br>
        For example in the example of cutoff frequency with a range from 100.0 to 22050.0 you might only want the selection to be in 10hz increments.  For this you would simply use 10.0 as the step value.<br>
        For a boolean, you can use min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0.  This way the only possible values are 0.0 and 1.0.<br>
        Some applications may detect min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0 and replace a graphical slider bar with a checkbox instead.<br>
        A step value of 1.0 would simulate integer values only.<br>
        A step value of 0.0 would mean the full floating point range is accessable.<br>

        [REMARKS]
        Note.  Every time the delay is changed, the plugin re-allocates the echo buffer.  This means the echo will dissapear at that time while it refills its new buffer.<br>
        Larger echo delays result in larger amounts of memory allocated.<br>
        <br>
        '<i>maxchannels</i>' also dictates the amount of memory allocated.  By default, the maxchannels value is 0.  If FMOD is set to stereo, the echo unit will allocate enough memory for 2 channels.  If it is 5.1, it will allocate enough memory for a 6 channel echo, etc.<br>
        If the echo effect is only ever applied to the global mix (ie it was added with System::addDSP), then 0 is the value to set as it will be enough to handle all speaker modes.<br>
        When the echo is added to a channel (ie Channel::addDSP) then the channel count that comes in could be anything from 1 to 8 possibly.  It is only in this case where you might want to increase the channel count above the output's channel count.<br>
        If a channel echo is set to a lower number than the sound's channel count that is coming in, it will not echo the sound.<br>

        [REMARKS]
        Flange is an effect where the signal is played twice at the same time, and one copy slides back and forth creating a whooshing or flanging effect.<br>
        As there are 2 copies of the same signal, by default each signal is given 50% mix, so that the total is not louder than the original unaffected signal.<br>
        <br>
        Flange depth is a percentage of a 10ms shift from the original signal.  Anything above 10ms is not considered flange because to the ear it begins to 'echo' so 10ms is the highest value possible.<br>

        [REMARKS]
        The tremolo effect varies the amplitude of a sound. Depending on the settings, this unit can produce a tremolo, chopper or auto-pan effect.<br>
        <br>
        The shape of the LFO (low freq. oscillator) can morphed between sine, triangle and sawtooth waves using the FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_SHAPE and FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_SKEW parameters.<br>
        FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_DUTY and FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_SQUARE are useful for a chopper-type effect where the first controls the on-time duration and second controls the flatness of the envelope.<br>
        FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_SPREAD varies the LFO phase between channels to get an auto-pan effect. This works best with a sine shape LFO.<br>
        The LFO can be synchronized using the FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_PHASE parameter which sets its instantaneous phase.<br>

        Normalize amplifies the sound based on the maximum peaks within the signal.<br>
        For example if the maximum peaks in the signal were 50% of the bandwidth, it would scale the whole sound by 2.<br>
        The lower threshold value makes the normalizer ignores peaks below a certain point, to avoid over-amplification if a loud signal suddenly came in, and also to avoid amplifying to maximum things like background hiss.<br>
        <br>
        Because FMOD is a realtime audio processor, it doesn't have the luxury of knowing the peak for the whole sound (ie it can't see into the future), so it has to process data as it comes in.<br>
        To avoid very sudden changes in volume level based on small samples of new data, fmod fades towards the desired amplification which makes for smooth gain control.  The fadetime parameter can control this.<br>

        Parameter types for the FMOD_DSP_TYPE_PITCHSHIFT filter.

        [REMARKS]
        This pitch shifting unit can be used to change the pitch of a sound without speeding it up or slowing it down.<br>
        It can also be used for time stretching or scaling, for example if the pitch was doubled, and the frequency of the sound was halved, the pitch of the sound would sound correct but it would be twice as slow.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Warning!</b> This filter is very computationally expensive!  Similar to a vocoder, it requires several overlapping FFT and IFFT's to produce smooth output, and can require around 440mhz for 1 stereo 48khz signal using the default settings.<br>
        Reducing the signal to mono will half the cpu usage, as will the overlap count.<br>
        Reducing this will lower audio quality, but what settings to use are largely dependant on the sound being played.  A noisy polyphonic signal will need higher overlap and fft size compared to a speaking voice for example.<br>
        <br>
        This pitch shifter is based on the pitch shifter code at http://www.dspdimension.com, written by Stephan M. Bernsee.<br>
        The original code is COPYRIGHT 1999-2003 Stephan M. Bernsee <smb@dspdimension.com>.<br>
        <br>
        '<i>maxchannels</i>' dictates the amount of memory allocated.  By default, the maxchannels value is 0.  If FMOD is set to stereo, the pitch shift unit will allocate enough memory for 2 channels.  If it is 5.1, it will allocate enough memory for a 6 channel pitch shift, etc.<br>
        If the pitch shift effect is only ever applied to the global mix (ie it was added with System::addDSP), then 0 is the value to set as it will be enough to handle all speaker modes.<br>
        When the pitch shift is added to a channel (ie Channel::addDSP) then the channel count that comes in could be anything from 1 to 8 possibly.  It is only in this case where you might want to increase the channel count above the output's channel count.<br>
        If a channel pitch shift is set to a lower number than the sound's channel count that is coming in, it will not pitch shift the sound.<br>

        The limiter is not guaranteed to catch every peak above the threshold level,

        determined by the attack time. However setting the attack time too short will
        distort the sound, so it is a compromise. High level peaks can be avoided by
        using a short attack time - but not too short, and setting the threshold a few
